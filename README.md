# Learning Three.js

This repository documents my personal journey learning [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL.

Each folder explores a specific category or technique, and contains notes and exercises to reinforce my understanding through hands-on practice.

## üöß Disclaimer

This repo is a personal learning project. Code may be messy, experimental, or incomplete ‚Äî it reflects real-world learning and iteration. Feel free to explore, borrow, or suggest improvements.

## üß† Learning Goals

- Understand how to build and structure 3D scenes in the browser
- Learn practical 3D techniques like lighting, shading, animation, and interaction
- Explore how shaders work and how to create custom visual effects
- Practice integrating Three.js into larger front-end frameworks like React

## üìÅ Folder Structure

### `Basics/`
Foundational Three.js concepts like setting up a scene, working with cameras, lights, meshes, and the render loop.

### `Classic Techniques/`
Covers common techniques including model loading, textures, shadows, environment maps, particle systems, and post-processing.

### `Advanced Techniques/`
Explores deeper topics like performance optimization, instancing, custom geometry, interactive experiences, and animation systems.

### `Shaders/`
Introduces GLSL and custom shader materials using `ShaderMaterial` or `RawShaderMaterial`. Also includes lighting models and procedural effects.

### `Extras/`
Miscellaneous experiments, utilities, and one-off ideas ‚Äî a sandbox for creativity or testing concepts that don't fit elsewhere.

### `Practice Portal Scene/`
A standalone creative project focused on designing a stylized 3D portal scene, applying multiple techniques from other categories.

### `Integration with React and React Three Fiber/`
Covers how to build Three.js projects using [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber), enabling declarative scene creation within React apps.

## üß± What's Inside Each Subfolder

Each subfolder typically includes:

- `notes.js` ‚Äî Contains written commentary, annotated code, or reflections on the topic.
- `Exercise/` ‚Äî A practical demo with a working implementation.

Inside each `Exercise/` folder:

- `src` - The files containing the majority of the code for this program. Within this folder there is an `index.html` file as the entry point for the example and a `script.js` file, which is the main JavaScript file implementing the concept.
- `package.json` ‚Äî Lists project dependencies and scripts
- `package-lock.json` ‚Äî Ensures consistent dependency versions across installs
- `node_modules/` ‚Äî All installed packages for that exercise

> üì¶ The `node_modules/` folder is **excluded** from each `Exercise/` folder in version control to reduce repo size. For the same reason, the `package-lock.json` may also be **excluded**. 
> Note: The projects in this repository rely in Vite as a bundler (as specified in the `package-lock.json` files)

## How to Run an Exercise Locally: 

1. Ensure you have installed Node.js and npm by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in the command-line. If either of these are not installed, install them.
3. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/arshdippamma/Three.js` in the command-line.
4. Navigate to the desired exercise's folder: `cd path/to/Exercise`
5. Install dependencies: `npm install`
6. Run `npm run dev` in the command-line and open the given http://localhost:XXXX/ link.
7. You should now see the exercise locally hosted in your browser.
